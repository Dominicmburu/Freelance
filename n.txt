I want us to refine something on the payment sections:
when a user enters card details, show suggestions of the type of card by an image. 
if the user has already entered the details show two cards:
card 1: show the balance and a button to add money.
card 2: show the card image type, and card number with stars for security and below it show the expiry date, then a button to update and delete the card.

<!-- Payment Section -->
        <div class="section-header">
            <h5>Payment</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
            <div class="card-details">
                <!-- Show this if card details are not saved -->
                
                <input type="text" class="form-control mb-3" placeholder="Card Number">
                <input type="text" class="form-control mb-3" placeholder="Expiry Date">
                <input type="text" class="form-control mb-3" placeholder="CVV">
                <button class="btn save-card-btn">SAVE CARD</button>
               

                <!-- Show this if card details are saved -->
                <p>Your Card: 1234 **** **** 5678</p>
                <button class="btn update-card-btn">UPDATE CARD</button>
                <button class="btn delete-card-btn">DELETE CARD</button>
            </div>
        </div>
